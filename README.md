# Water Control System

## Research Paper Idea:
The proposed palm tree irrigation control system from Al company is a multifaceted model that combines fuzzy logic technology with Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing techniques. Data is collected from temperature and soil moisture sensors, then the Fuzzy Logic system determines the correct amount of water the pump should supply to the palm trees.

## Variables of this model:

temperature: Represents the weather temperature, with a range of [0, 50].
SoilMoisture: Represents soil moisture, with a range of [0, 100].
Based on the inputs (SoilMoisture - temperature), the variable "amount of water" will be generated, representing the appropriate amount of water for irrigating the palm tree.
